// What are Functions??
 // we can calculate the area of one rectangle with the following steps everything time!!

const width = 10;
const height = 6
const area = width * height;
console.log(area); //output will be 60

//now imagine being asked to calculate the area of three different rectangles
// so you would carry out the first method three times logically, however in programming language we can code to make a specific task run several times instead of writing it for each area of rectangle for example, we achieve this by writing a function.
// FUNCTION is a reusable block of code that groups together a sequence of statements to perform a specific task.

// what does a function declaratoin consist of??
// function keyword followed by the identifier which is the name of the funtion by which you represent the function itself, and  the function body which is inside curly brackets {}.This is the block statemets required to perform a specific task, enclosed in the function.

// we should be aware of the hoisting feature in javescript as it allows access to function declarations before they are defined.

//Task done on codeacademy for creating a function that prints a reminder to the console. Using a function declaration, create a function called getReminder()
